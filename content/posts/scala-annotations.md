## What are annotations in scala?

Annotations in Scala are metadata tags applied to declarations or expressions, which can be used by the Scala compiler, or a third-party tool.
They can provide additional information or instructions to the compiler, or customize the generated code.

Here are some common uses of annotations in Scala:

1. Compiler checks: @unchecked, @deprecated, @inline
2. Type-checking: @tailrec, @specialized
3. Generating boilerplate code: @scala.reflect.BeanProperty, @getter, @setter
4. Frameworks/libraries: @Path, @RequestMapping, @SpringBootApplication, etc.

Annotations in Scala are denoted by the '@' symbol, followed by the name of the annotation and optional arguments within parentheses.

For example the annotation @deprecated before a method causes the compiler to print a warning if the method is used.

```scala
object DeprecationDemo extends App:
  @deprecated("deprecation message", "release # which deprecates method")
    def hello = "hola"

      hello
```

This will compile but the compiler will print a warning: “there was one deprecation warning”.

An annotation clause applies to the first definition or declaration following it. More than one annotation clause may precede a definition and declaration. The order in which these clauses are given does not matter.



## How about the `@volatile` annotation?

The `@volatile` annotation in Scala is used to declare a field as volatile.
Volatile fields are special in that they can be read and written by multiple threads and provide visibility and ordering guarantees.
When a field is declared volatile, the JVM ensures that the latest value written to the field by one thread is visible to all other threads, and all changes to the volatile field are atomic.

Here's an example of how to declare a volatile field in Scala:

```scala
@volatile
var count = 0
```

Note that @volatile is a Scala-specific annotation and is not a standard Java feature. The equivalent in Java would be to use the volatile keyword when declaring the field:

```java
volatile int count = 0;
```

In general, volatile fields should be used sparingly and only in situations where visibility and atomicity guarantees are important, as access to volatile fields is slower than to non-volatile fields.
